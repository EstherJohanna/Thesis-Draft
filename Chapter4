This thesis employed two methods for predicting takeover time. One was a data-driven, statistical approach, and another was a theoretically-driven, cognitive modeling approach. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. A benefit of the cognitive approach is that time-intensive data collection is not necessary, if papers have been published on the topic. These can be used for validation. From a scientific point of view, cognitive architectures have the asset of understanding why actions take how long, compared to a `black box' for the statistical method. On the other hand, validating the cognitive architecture predictions with data only from literature is questionable. As expected, a linear regression model fitted to experimental data leads to a higher $R^2$ than a theoretically set up model fits to the experimental data. An upside of the statistical method is that one can be certain to have `real-world proof' for the model's predictions. On the other hand, the statistical method holds greater danger of over-fitting the data. Also, statistical data can only predict what happened in experiments and is constrained by all flaws in experimental setup. Cognitive architectures therefore might be better suited to estimate the time the driver needs for a calm and well-planned takeover. In the end, it depends on personal preference and the aim of research which of the two methods should be preferred. 
\\
When using Gold’s equation to predict our experimental data, $R^2$ is 0.004. It is striking that when varying time budget, Gold’s equation predicts takeover times of a wide variety, but when changing any of the other variables, the model's prediction changes only in a millisecond-range. This outcome is contrary to that of our experiments. He includes the variables `Traffic', `Time Budget', `Lane', `Traffic Density', `Repetition' and `Age', which might be summarized as variables that influence perceived urgency as well as cognitive challenge of the takeover. Motor variables are missing in his equation, which is something that we find to have a relevant influence. Thus might be due to the fact the he does not concentrate on including demanding motor tasks in his experiments.
\\
In the end, it is important to remember that significance does not mean causality. A correlation between variables and takeover time are an indicator for causality, but do not prove that these variables are the cause for changes in takeover time. 
 
 
\section{Outlook}
To develop a full picture of individual takeover time differences, additional studies will be needed that find predictors that evaluate the driver’s ‘personal’ takeover-speed. Research questions that could be asked include ‘What exactly determine those individual differences?’ and ‘How can we measure something that successfully predicts someone’s general takeover speed?’ 
\\
Additionally, further research should be undertaken to investigate ‘normative’ takeover time and compare it to the cognitive-motor model’s output. At the moment, the model's output is considered to be the mean of the Weibull-distribution. This can easily be changed to taking the model's output as location parameter (=threshold above which the distribution starts). This, in a strict sense, would make more sense when considering that substep-times are taken from the times an action takes in ACT-R, and time variance in ACT-R is achieved by preceding this action time by time it takes to choose a production rule based on its utility. Consequently, our outcome should represent a minimum time. We chose to set it as mean time due to a better fit to our data. This should be checked by more data on normative takeovers and possibly adjusted accordingly. Of course, also the statistical model will be improved by fitting it to more data. 
\\
There are still unanswered questions about NDRT that will be chosen by drivers voluntarily. Except for \cite{feldhuetter2016}, current studies force secondary tasks onto participants, which might have influence on intensity of distraction and mental involvement.
\\
At this moment, the steps the cognitive-motor model goes through are purely theoretical. The results for the single substeps, which are not (and hardly can be) verified by experimental data need to be interpreted with caution.
\\
Also data on how humans react when a real critical situation emerges would be needed. Further trials should assess the impact of using real cars on a real road, instead of a driving simulator. Moreover, considerably more work will need to be done to determine takeover times after longer times of driving. It would be interesting to do a study design in which the design matrix contains all combinations of variables, which leads to optimal regression results. This research should be repeated at a time that humans are not very used to driving anymore, and being out of practice will reduce their ability to react accordingly. 
\\
In future investigations, it might be possible to find further variables that influence takeover time that have been overseen thus far.
