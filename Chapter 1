\section{Take Over!}

While holding a cup of coffee and her cell phone in the one hand, Alice is trying to put back on her son's sock with the other. Struggling with his stubborn resistance, she is looking for a place to put down the cup of coffee, when suddenly a loud sound brings her back to reality: `Please take over driving!', a friendly voice requests. While Alice is hectically trying to find a place for her coffee cup, the noise becomes louder and more urgent. Her son starts crying, and when Alice looks out of the windshield she sees that her car is rapidly approaching road works blocking the street in front of her...
\\
Is Alice ready to take over driving now? And if no, how long does it take until she is?
\\
This scenario could be a realistic situation within a few year's time. Bosch and Daimler promised to get highly automated driving cars on the road by 2020 (\cite{}). Compared to completely autonomous cars, highly automated cars (SAE and BASt Level 3, see Fig. \ref{64}) have one relevant difference: there will be situations coming up that require a human driver to take over the driving task. Highly automated driving on SAE Level three will allow the driver to completely disengage from the driving task for certain periods of times. During these, the driver will be allowed to occupy with any task he likes to. These tasks are only limited by that the driver has to be able to perceive the takeover request. Most likely, he will also have to stay seated in the driver seat. These activities can range from doing nothing to the above-mentioned example - and everything in between. At any moment, there are options for a takeover to become necessary. One is that the car's sensors fail, another that unexpected situations (like a road block) occur, amongst others. For these cases, the human driver is needed as a fall-back option. Depending on his current state, the driver will take longer or shorter until he is ready to take over manual driving. For every driver state, it needs to be clear how long he would need to be ready. In case that a critical scenario will be reached before the driver is ready, the car enters a minimal-risk state like parking on the hard shoulder. On the other hand, it is not desirable to have a long row of parked cars in front of any road block. Therefore, if the driver is estimated to be ready to take over in time, he should be requested to take over. For this, it is essential to estimate driver readiness appropriately.

Why worry about highly automated driving when completely autonomous cars are already on the way, one might wonder? Tesla and Google are driving on US roads completely automated - only for trials, until now. But Tesla's CEO Elon Musk announces first fully autonomous cars to be publicly available by 2019 \cite{}. What makes highly automated driving relevant are user acceptance and law adaptation. Cars will drive automated only on highways in the coming years. Law changes for that case are much easier than for fully autonomous cars. Algorithms for highways do not have to take into account the danger of surrounding pedestrians, bikes, crossroads etc. This means there will always be a moment in which the highway exit approaches - and the human driver needs to take back control.  Blabla even says that fully autonomous cars will be accepted or allowed in Europe \cite{FAZ Artikel}.  

What in the end decides whether highly automated driving will sell or not is user acceptance. Therefore, it is essential to keep the human in mind when designing solutions on HAD. The transition from automated to manual driving should not only be safe, but also comfortable. For this, several factors have to be taken into account. For example, a takeover will take longer when the driver is tired, extremely distracted by a secondary task, or positioned in a way that will make it time-intensive to turn back to the steering wheel. The car needs to notice this difference and take it into account by warning the driver earlier. That way, the driver will be requested to take over at a time that, depending on driver state and given situation, warns early enough to make a comfortable and safe takeover possible.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Taking Over Control in Highly Automated Driving}

all the blabla about takeover studies (literature table machen!)
auf jeden fall referenz Mioch und Zeeb.(plot of takeover times of different studies?).

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SEA) formulated as one of the requirements for SAE Level 3 that it is expected that `the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene'. Since that, numerous studies have tried to determine experimentally how much time the driver needs in order to ensure this `appropriate response'. The two most important measures during those studies are takeover time and takeover quality. This thesis will focus on takeover time, which is usually defined as the time from a request to intervene (=takeover request) to either braking, steering or a button press.

%The definition of takeover time varies between publications. While for most the takeover time is the time from the takeover request to the first steering, braking, acceleration or a button press, for others it is bla. Also, it differs whether the drivers were able to   accidentally   see the obstacle before the takeover request, or whether it appeared together with the request. In this thesis, takeover time will refer only to the time from takeover request to braking steering, acceleration or button press when the obstacle was not visible before. Everything else will be explicitly mentioned. Takeover quality has been measured in several ways, some of them being bla , bla and bla. 

The time budget is the time from takeover request to an obstacle or the end of scenario. In 2012, Damb√∂ck et al. started off with giving the driver a time budget of 4, 6 or 8 seconds and evaluating how many mistakes (lane deviation, crash into obstacle, ...) the driver made (\cite{uebernahmeHAF}). He found that while most people would have crashed into the obstacle at a four second time budget, they made it with 6 seconds while making many mistakes, and mostly were fine with an 8 second time budget. Gold et al. then conducted a study measuring takeover time and quality, depending on the time budget of 5 or 7 seconds (\cite{Gold2013}). He found that from take-over request to braking it takes on average 2.06 second in the 5 second time budget condition, and 3.1 seconds in the 7 second time budget condition. Thus, we assume that with a shorter time budget, the driver's perception of urgency decreases his reaction time. On the other hand, Gold found that takeover quality decreases with a shorter time budget. Petermann-Stock et al. find takeover times with a mean of 2.3 seconds and a maximum of 8 seconds depending on age and non-driving related tasks (\cite{petermann2013lange}). Naujoks et al. showed that participants react faster to visual-auditory than only visual take-over request, with average take-over times of 6.9 and 2.3 seconds, respectively (\cite{naujoks2014effect}). Radlmayr et al. test different traffic densities and non-driving related tasks. They find times from takeover request to steering or braking of 1.55 to 2.92 seconds on average, with a maximum of 4.55 seconds. They find a significant difference for traffic density, but not NDTR. Gold et al. one year later does find a significant influence of non-driving related tasks, with a takeover time of 1.3 seconds without a task, and 2.2 seconds in the most demanding (`motor-cognitive') task (\cite{Gold2015}). Another study investigating the influence of non-driving elated tasks was Befelein et al, who tested four non-driving related tasks and found takeover times between 2.4 to 4.8 seconds (\cite{befelein2016}). By far the longest takeover times were found by Eriksson et al., who investigated noncritical takeover situations and non-driving related tasks (\cite{eriksson2016take}). He found takeover times between 2 to 25.6 seconds. Also Vollrath et al. investigate secondary tasks, finding that for drivers who played tetris it took 11.2 seconds until all drivers had taken over; for reading drivers it took 9 seconds and observing drivers 7 seconds before everyone had taken over (\cite{unfallforschung}). 
Lorenz et al. show a mean takeover time of 2.91 with augmented reality support (\cite{Lorenz2014}). This time only very slightly differs between a positive   (where to go) , a negative (where not to go) assisting augmented reality and the control condition without support. Strand et al. test how long subjects need to take over in case of automation failure and finds mean takeover times from 1.85 to 2.57 seconds in the highly automated condition. These times are not fully comparable because no request to intervene was issued and conditions differed in the level of failure between moderate, severe or complete (\cite{strand2014semi}). Whether the modality and presentation of the TOR make a difference was tested in Melcher 2015, who found takeover times of 3.42 to 3.77 seconds but no significant difference between the tested conditions (\cite{melcher2015take}). Also Belderbos et al. checking for the influence of different human machine interfaces with a mean takeover time of 5.9 seconds did not find an influence of his conditions (\cite{belderbos2015authority}). Contrary to that, Kerschbaum et al. do find an influence of a transformable steering wheel with mean takeover times from 2.22 to 3.09 seconds (\cite{kerschbaum2015transforming}). 



walch 2015? check what he did in other table
Zeeb et al. classify drivers into high-, medium- and low risk gaze behavior types which take 2.31, 1.86 and 1.63 seconds for taking over, respectively. She concludes that gaze behavior predicts cognitive, but not motor readiness. While he finds that a subject  s previously measured multitasking ability predicts their takeover time, K√∂rber et al. showed the obstacle before the takeover time, which lead to times of 600ms, 20ms, -800ms, -500ms and -1800ms. The negative number indicates that the subject took over before the takeover request. 
for louw 2015 also check other table
While Payre et al. tested for the influence of trust and practice finding taeover times of 2 to 15 seconds, they were again not considered in out further bla because participants were not warned about a takeover request. 
Feldh√ºtter et al. found means of 1.88 to 2.24 seconds when making a takeover request after either 5 or 20 minutes of driving (check this!), which did not seem to have an influence. 
K√∂rber et al. found no influence of age on takeover time, which had means of 2.4 to 3.6 seconds. In the same study he did find an influence of traffix density and learning (nochmal checken!)Another study by Gold found a relevant influence of traffic density, but not the secondary task of 20 questions (means from 2.5 to 3.6). Maas found an influence of information presentation (blabla vs. blabla) and means from 1.9 to 3 seconds. 
In the introduction of her next paper, Zeeb reviews studies that have been done so far about takeover time. in her own study, she finds no influence of nondriving related tasks and means from 2.4 to 3.5 seconds. In his 2016 study, Bueno finds means of around 3.6 seconds in both (check!) of his conditions for mental workload. 


mention whether its mean or range!

\subsection{Cognitive Architectures}

Cognitive Architectures are Artificial Intelligence that does not try to be perfect, but exactly like a human. They can model human behavior on different levels: While some model on the low level at the basis of neuronal firing (Nengo, cite bla), others model on task (ACT-R cite bla) or even multiple task level (PRIMs cite bla). Because we were interested in high-level behavior modeling, the subsequent introduction will outline the basics of ACT-R. 

Of cognitive architectures, ACT-R is the best known (and therefore best described) one. Adavantages over other cognitive architectures is that it ... . 

everything about ACT-R - from the ppt about the spring school, and salvuccis driver papers and how he did it
also compare it to PRIMs and others

\section{Aim of the thesis}
taking all this together I will only concentrate on takeover TIME because blabla. I will use ACT-R and not PRIMs because Mac and existing model and bigger community. and not others because they  re either shitty or not publicly available. 

which factors we got as important out of the papers and which ones we in the end greyed out because theyre ifficult to measure etc. got the most influenctial factors from regression analysis.
